== Description ==
Logging your mail will stop you from ever losing your emails again! This fast, lightweight plugin (under 140kb in size!) is also useful for debugging or backing up your messages.

Just install and activate then all of your contact form emails will be logged and saved to your DB with no additional configuration required.

View and manage all your form submissions through the default WordPress interface. An email failed to send? With a single click you can resend the backed up email.

Send emails out directly from the WordPress interface. Also includes support for attachments.

Immediately find out if your contact form submission was successfully sent.
